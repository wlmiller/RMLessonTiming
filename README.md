RM Lesson Timing
======

The main code for calculating lesson time is [lessontiming.py](lessontiming.py).

This code estimates lesson lengths for RM lessons.  The code asks the user to select the OS file for the lesson; it requires the OS file name to include the lesson number and the lesson item scripts to be located in a directory called `Scripts/` in the same directory as the OS file.
